readDirectory.js:
    - Make it so that only audio files are returned (filter out non-audio files)
    - Maybe make an exception where a file can have a certain name (such as "youtubePLaylist.txt") where it can read url links and play them with react-player

Logger.js:
    - Make it utilize the winston library from npm

New Application Requirements:
    - Have a button to add a youtube playlist (or individual video) to the player
        - the user might need to choose whether he wants to add the url link to a file, download the actual video, or any other action (that I might think of later).

        
To pick up: 
    continue playing with different libraries to see what can play audio.
